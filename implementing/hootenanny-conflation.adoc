The second conflation dataset. 

=== conflation_type
The type of conflation, either average or reference.

=== match threshold
The threshold for calling a relationship a match. Defaults to 0.6. The higher the value the lower the TPR, but likely also the lower the FPR

=== miss_threshold
The threshold for calling a relationship a miss. Defaults to 0.6. The higher the value the lower the TNR, but likely also the lower the FNR.

=== reference_layer
The reference layer which will be dominant tags. Default is 1 and if 2 selected, layer 2 tags will be dominant with layer 1 as geometry snap layer.

== Outputs

=== conflation_output

The conflated dataset.

=== conflation_report

A log of the conflation execution.
