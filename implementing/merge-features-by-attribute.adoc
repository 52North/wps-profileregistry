The features are merged by attribute and optional additional by distance. If the specified attribute of two features is equal (and optionally if they fall in the specified distance), a union of the points is done and the resulting feature is added to the result set.

== Inputs

=== distance
The distance of the features that should be considered for merging.
This should be a double value.

=== classfield
The attribute field that should be checked for equalness.
This should be a string value.

=== data
The features that should be generalized. The attribute chosen for the input _classfield_ must be present. The data-format should be zipped shapefile, optionally encoded in base64.

== Outputs

=== result

The generalized features. The data-format should be zipped shapefile, optionally encoded in base64.
