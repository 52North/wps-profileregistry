=== Douglas Peucker Line Simplification
The line-features are simplified by a tolerance. The algorithm optionally preserves the topology of the input features. The process is based on the Java Topology Suite (JTSfootnote:[http://tsusiatsoftware.net/jts/main.html]) implementation of the DouglasPeucker algorithm.


== Inputs

=== data
The features that should be simplified. The data-format should be zipped shapefile, optionally encoded in base64.

=== tolerance
The tolerance for the douglas peucker algorithm.
This should be a double value.

=== preserve_topology
Whether the algorithm should preserve the topology of the input features.
This should be a boolean value.

== Outputs

=== result

The simplified features. The data-format should be zipped shapefile, optionally encoded in base64.
