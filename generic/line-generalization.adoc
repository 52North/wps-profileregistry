=== Line generalization
The line-features are simplified by a tolerance. The algorithm optionally preserves the topology of the input features.

== Inputs

=== data
The line-features that should be simplified. 

=== tolerance
The tolerance for the line generalization.

=== preserve_topology
Whether the algorithm should preserve the topology of the input features.

== Outputs

=== result

The simplified features.
